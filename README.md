# `unittest.mock` Demo

A rough-around-the-edges Python project to help demonstrate some weirdo behavior when using `unittest.mock`.

The structure is deliberately overcomplicated - it's been made to mimic a real-life project and third-party package that inspired this exercise.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 (probs doesn't matter if you use something older)
- `pytest` (`python -m pip install pytest`)

## Running Tests

Run tests with:

```py
pytest tests
```
